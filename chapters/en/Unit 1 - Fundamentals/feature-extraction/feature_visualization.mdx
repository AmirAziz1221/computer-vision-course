# Feature Visualization

In the last sections we have seen different kinds of features, learned about feature descriptors and how to use features to find matches between images.

In this section we will have a look at how to visualize some of the most common features and how that can help us to understand the data better. In the end
we will also have a look at the shortcomings of the "traditional" CV features and how Artificial Neural Networks, especially Convolutional Neural Networks,
can help us to overcome those.

## Corner Detector Visualizations

A simple way to detect at least half-way meaningful and descriptive parts in an image are corner detectors, like Harris or Shi-Tomasi.
Visualizing the features they detected is mostly done by simply adding an overlay to the original image, pointing out
the detected corners. As in the following example, using the `goodFeaturesToTrack` method from OpenCV, which by default uses the
Shi-Tomasi Corner Detection:

```bash
!pip install opencv-python
```

```python
import cv2
import numpy
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
```

```python
img = cv.imread('img1.jpg')
gray = cv.cvtColor(img,cv.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
corners = cv.goodFeaturesToTrack(gray,25,0.01,10)
corners = np.int0(corners)
for i in corners:
    x,y = i.ravel()
    cv.circle(img,(x,y),3,255,-1)
plt.imshow(img),plt.show()
```

The advantage of these features is that they are very easy to identify and easily understandable for humans.
The downside however is the fact that corners are still pretty weak features and can mainly be used for things
like matching images or tracking objects. When it comes to more sophisticated tasks like e.g. classifying animals,
corners don't get you far.
